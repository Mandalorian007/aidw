Implement the plan in `{{ plan_path }}`.

1. Read and follow the plan exactly
2. Write clean, idiomatic code
3. Add tests that verify the implementation
4. Update documentation as specified in the plan

Commit with clear messages. The PR description will be updated with implementation details.

After implementing, update `{{ plan_path }}` to mark completed items and note any deviations from the original plan.
